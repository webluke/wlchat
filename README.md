# wl.chat

This is a simple clone prototype of t3.chat. It is in response to Theo's post on Twitter https://x.com/theo/status/1931515264497254402

Expect a lot of changes in the future as I will be adding more features and improving the codebase.

You can demo the app at https://chat.webluke.net (This is running on a low spec VM and the models are running on stock 2024 macMini so don't expect much.)
